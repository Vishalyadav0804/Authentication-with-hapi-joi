# Authentication-with-hapi-joi

@hapi/joi
The most powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.
joi is part of the hapi ecosystem and was designed to work seamlessly with the hapi web framework and its other components (but works great on its own or with other frameworks). If you are using a different web framework and find this module useful, check out hapi â€“ they work even better together.

Installation:
npm: npm install @hapi/joi

yarn: yarn add @hapi/joi
